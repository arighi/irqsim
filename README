irqsim - IRQ-based device simulator
===================================

Simple kernel module, written for didactic purposes, to explain the concept
of deferred work and understand the different kernel contextes and their
properties / constraints.

This module covers the following concepts:
  - irq,
  - softirq,
  - tasklet,
  - workqueue,
  - kernel thread,
  - kernel code,
  - userspace code.

This module can be also used as a template to implement an IRQ-based device
driver.
